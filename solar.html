        <h1>Solar panel maintenance at a glance:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Solar panels require very little maintenance, especially if they are on a tilt, as rain can wash
                away any debris.</li>
            <li>It is generally recommended that you perform solar panel cleaning between two and four times per
                year.</li>
            <li>Using a monitoring app can help you keep track of the amount of energy your panels produce. If you
                notice a dip in production, it might be time to clean your panels.</li>
            <li>Solar panel maintenance and cleaning is not covered under panel warranties, but if your solar panels
                are damaged, they will usually be covered.

        <h1>Government Subsidy On Solar Panel In India 2023</h1>
        <p>The current ministry that has the role of enforcing Renewable Energy Laws In India for solar energy is
            the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The church's objective is to develop and deploy new and
            renewable energy. This renewable energy helps enhance the country's solar and other renewable sources.
            To promote the use of renewable energy, the government has provided various exemptions in indirect
            taxes, including sales tax, excise duty, and customs duty.</p>
        <p>The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy stated that India had received about 5,000 trillion kWh of solar
            energy over its land. India has very few sources of fossil fuels which compels the country to be highly
            dependent on gulf countries. Solar energy can be the most secure source as it is abundant. In the
            current scenario, India is using 38% of the total solar capacity.</p>
        <p>The first initiative towards the development and usage of solar energy was the National Solar Mission
            which was initiated in the year 2010. This development plan, also known as Jawaharlal Nehru National
            Solar Mission (JNNSM), was a part of the India National Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). NAPCC is a
            mission-mode action for sustainable growth inaugurated by the Government of India in 2008. The primary
            objective is to promote the solar mission and make this energy source competitive with fossil fuels. The
            establishment of the solar research center development of solar technology with international
            collaboration on technology development took place to gain maximum government funding and international
            support.</p>

            <p>AI is real and it works. As more mundane tasks are automated by machine learning and AI, people have
                increasingly more time to devote to developing relationships with customers. With its ability to
                comb through big data sets like email faster and more accurately than humans, AI will help more
                product teams maintain product-market fit. AI can also simplify data unification by providing more
                streamlined, intelligent processing for the people, teams and systems that need accurate insights to
                build better businesses.</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p>2023 will be a big year gaining market traction in new customer intelligence platforms. They collect
                text and transcripts from multiple channels (Email, Slack, Zoom, etc.), apply natural language
                processing (NLP), artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to mine signals hiding in
                plain sight.

                We humans reveal subconscious, emotional markers in the spoken, written, and even body language we
                use. Customer sentiment, intention, and level of trust can be surfaced and incorporated into more
                predictive customer health scores while providing valuable insights and feedback to CSMs and account
                managers. These technologies are at an early stage of development but maturing quickly, and the
                sky’s the limit on what it can do.</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p>2023 should be the year during which we will see this concentration of energy around the
                democratization of data drive the development of more widespread digital-first Customer Success
                models.</p>
